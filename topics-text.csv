Motivation,"<p>Motivation is an important component of the complex context that empowers a student to learn effectively.</p>To be motivated is to be moved to perform an action or engage in an activity. There are many theories of motivation in education, the most popular today being: expectancy theory (motivation increases with the expectation of reaching a goal and the goal’s value (Graham & Weiner, 1996, Liu et al., 2011); similar to self-efficacy (Bandura & McClelland, 1977, Bandura, 1989, Bandura, 2010)) the ARCS model (Pillars of motivation in education: attention, relevance, confidence and satisfaction, self-regulation (Keller, 2008)) self-determination theory (autonomy, competence and relatedness (Deci & Ryan, 1985))."

Critical Thinking,"Freire saw critical thinking as a tool for self-determination and civic engagement, a way of thinking that recognizes reality as a transformative process rather than a static construct. Sternberg (1986) defined critical thinking as the sum of the mental processes, strate- gies and representations people use to solve problems, make decisions, and learn new concepts. <p>What is thinking? Magolda (1992), who interviewed 101 students, men and women in a five year, longitudinal study, explored how the 'ways of knowing' developed for these students throughout their academic career. Based on this research, Magolda defined four different developmental levels of thinking: basic or absolute thinking, where students have a black and white view of the world, transitional thinking, where student start accepting that there is always some sort of uncertainty in the knowledge they are acquiring, independent thinking, when they are able to reach their own conclusions, and contextual thinking, where they understand that perspective can be affected by context. </p> <p>Moon(2007) defined critical thinking as the 'capacity to work with complex ideas whereby a person can make effective provision of evidence to justify a reasonable judgement. The evidence and therefore the judgement, will pay appropriate at- tention to context'. Critical thinking is an umbrella term that can be used for a complex and sophisticated set of thinking skills.</p>",who
Engagement,"Trowler(2010) defined student engagement as 'the interaction between the time, effort and other relevant resources invested by both students and their institutions intended to optimise the student experience and enhance the learning outcomes and development of students and the performance, and reputation of the institution'. <p>The opposite of engagement is alienation (Mann, 2001), but instead of engaged, students may also experience inertia, apathy, disillusion, as well as the engagement of other pursuits (K. Krause, 2005). Laurel (Laurel, 1991) likened the concept of engagement to the concept of suspension of disbelief. This term was first used in early 19th century by poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who referred to the reader’s response to poetry, and has since been used to describe the complicity and participation of the individual with art in general. The same is valid for education, where the student must willingly enter the territory of representation, while still thinking of the abstract concepts that informs it. </p><p>Student engagement has also been defined as 'participation in educationally effec- tive practices, both inside and outside the classroom, which leads to a range of measurable outcomes' (Kuh, 2007).</p>",who
Digital Learning Environment,"There is a broad variety of digital environments, from learning management systems (LMS), to broader content management systems, social networks and other systems that can be used for learning or complement learning.<p>Throughout the use and development of DLEs, instructors and researchers should also consider the covert values, beliefs and assumptions that any learning technology may encompass (Veletsianos, 2016). The fact that drop-out rates in digital learning tends to be 10-20% higher than in-person learning (Carr, 2000, Diaz, 2002), suggests that there is room for improvement in terms of engaging and motivating digital learners.<.p>",who
Professors ,"The data from this study suggested that even if they recognized the importance of their own guidance and its effect on student motivation, the teachers did not recognize the challenges and particularities of digital students or the importance of peer support and social learning for this type of “social-connection-hungry” students. <p>Some teachers were acutely aware of these factors and used the open-ended fields of the questionnaire to make a point about the limitations of DLE and how students can be better supported, mentioning the additional effort the instructor should make: being proactive about feedback, creating communication mechanisms on top of what the interaction design of the DLE offers, building and maintaining rapport with the students and creating a feeling of being present in their academic lives, the usefulness of giving feedback by using a variety of media.</p>",who
Time ,"In e-learning, the temporal dimension, has to do, among other elements, with learning rhythms, curricular timings, teacher and peer support, feedback, study calendars and the durations of courses, latency of online discourse, validated qualifications and previous knowledge ​​(Barberà, 2010). In this study, we wanted to better understand whether students’ self-reported motivation and critical stimulation changed in time and how.",who
Increased motivation,"The number of students who said they were motivated increased, while the number of students who said they were not motivated decreased, at the end of the trimester.",who
Increased intellectual stimulation,"The appreciation for the way in which their course was supporting them to think critically also increased in time. As the course progressed, fewer students reported not thinking critically; more students seemed to be unsure whether they were indeed thinking critically or not",who
Ease of use,"The most notable changes in their self-reported behaviour had to do with their perception of ease of use of their digital learning environment itself, which, after three months of use, became more familiar to them",who
Feedback,"Students who were motivated and critically engaged with their learning also seemed to be well-connected with role models, either members of their family who supported them emotionally or professors they admired. In contrast, students who reported feeling demotivated or not critically engaged with their learning were disenchanted with their instructors and peers, and felt alone. Some teachers in the study were acutely aware of these factors and used the open-ended fields of the questionnaire to make a point about the limitations of digital learning environments and how students can be better supported, mentioning the additional effort the instructor should make, from being proactive about feedback, to creating communication mechanisms on top of what the interaction design of the DLE offers, to building and maintaining rapport with the students and creating a feeling of being present in their academic lives, to the usefulness of giving feedback by using a variety of media.",who
Communication mechanisms,"Students who were motivated and critically engaged with their learning: they were primarily strongly intrinsically motivated. Some were motivated by the intellectual challenge itself, other by the ability to help others, later in their careers, or the prospect of a better job, which would offer their families a better life. They were driven, they felt competent and confident they could achieve their goals as long as they put in the necessary work. In contrast, students who reported feeling demotivated or not critically engaged with their learning were disenchanted with their instructors and peers, they felt restricted by the DLE, and that their learning had to fit into a pre-designed pattern.",who
Student-intructor messaging tools,"A significant correlation was observed between critical thinking and the use of a private messaging tool, for both questionnaires. During the interviews students mentioned that they felt alone, isolated, that their DLE was limiting their contact with others and that it made them less likely to ask questions or start debates, compared to their previous traditional learning experiences.",who
Group work tools,"Social learning is based on four premises: humans are social beings, knowledge is competence in respect to valued enterprises, knowing is participating in valued enterprises and active engagement in the world, and finally,learning produces meaning (Wenger, 1998). Even though relatively few students reported using a group work tool, in January, more students reported having used one, 9%, compared to 4% in October. When imagining their ideal DLE all students imagined it as including a way to connect with others, with one student imagining artificial intelligence that understood her challenges and supported her in finding answers to her questions.",who
Spaces to connect,"Individual learning that takes place in a social context and is thus influenced by social and moral rules (Bandura, 1977). An active participation in the practices of social communities and constructing identities in relation with these communities (Lave, 1988, Wenger, 1998). Lave (1988) argued: 'Knowledge does not consist of coherent, clean-cut islands, whose boundaries exist independently of individuals'.The students I talked with in this study mostly felt disconnected from their peers. The loss of connectedness and sense of community in digital classrooms has been observed before by researchers such as Johnson and Brescia Jr. (2006) and Liu et al (2011). During the interviews, most students mentioned, as their favorite part of their DLE, tools that enabled them to do group work and collaborate and connect digitally. ",who
Dialogue ,"Dialogue is not a technique, that can be mechanically repeated or a classroom tactic, dialogue is a way of knowing. Dialogue needs an environment of acceptance and tolerance, it needs humility. The challenge with dialogue in digital education is that it cannot be standardized. Many students I’ve interviewed, otherwise motivated and engaged with their learning, believed their digital learning environment did not promote dialogue, nor critical thinking sufficiently.",who 
Use of features,"No correlation between the intellectual stimulation variable and the number of features a student had reported using on a regular basis was observed. Thus, merely using more features of the DLE did not show any relationship with students’ self-reported critical thinking.",who
Real world problems,"Students said that they would be more successful if they received more support from teachers and if the teachers would focus more on the “real-world” aspects of their curriculum and their learning, rather than “useless” theory. During the interviews, a theme that came up was that the DLE itself cannot be motivating, but rather than the people students interact with, their peers and teachers motivated them. Teachers were mentioned most often as drivers of student motivation",who
Habits of the mind,"For students living in the era of fake news and deepfakes, critical thinking is an essential tool they need to navigate the world and the democratic societies they live in. Dialogue is a luxury in a society in which we are all time-poor, and our patience is short, and our aim is to continuously optimize our efforts in order to increase productivity. When asked whether their instructor was helping them think critically, 41% of students said their instructor helps a lot in October, and 45% in January. 52% had said their instructor somehow helps in October and 52% in January. Only 7% in October and 3% in January had said their instructor does not help them at all think more critically. Overall, the vast majority of students said that their instructor was helping them think critically.When performing the Kendall correlation test for the first questionnaire, a strong statistically significant correlation was observed between critical thinking and engagement with instructors. The correlation score for the second questionnaire was also very strong, however the data was found to be statistically insignificant."
