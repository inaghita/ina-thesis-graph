                        The field of digital learning has rapidly evolved during the last seventy years, from initially being mostly concerned with how machines could help humans learn, to now putting the student at the centre of learning and aiming to understand phe- nomena that impact the success of students. However, there is little research today on how the design of the digital learning environments uses motivation and engage- ment to shape studentsâ€™ thinking and prepare them for becoming critically thinking, participative, motivated members of society.

                        Digital students have specific needs and face challenges that have to do with the lack of direct human contact, mediation of communication, asynchronicity, as well as managing their attention and resources during study. The overarching research question of this study was: "What motivates post-secondary digital students to learn and engage with their course, peers, and instructors, in a way that supports critical thinking?". To answer this question, a mixed methods explanatory sequential design was em- ployed. The data was collected from a professor questionnaire (n=30), a longitudinal study consisting of two student questionnaires (n=73), and interviews, email, tele- phone and chat conversations with 10 of the students in the sample.
                        This thesis contributes to bridging the gap between aspects of motivation and en- gagement in digital learning environments that support critical thinking for post- secondary students, by offering a holistic view of the relationships between these factors, as students saw them. The experimental design allowed for a nuanced view of the experience of digital learning for university students. For educational practi- tioners, this thesis contributes to integrating the concepts of critical thinking and the practice of dialogue to motivation and engagement studies, moving research away from interventionist studies, into an integrated conceptualization of student expe- rience in digital learning environments, where motivation, engagement and critical thinking are studied together.
